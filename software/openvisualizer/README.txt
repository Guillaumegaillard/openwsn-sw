OpenVisualizer is part of UC Berkeley's OpenWSN project. It provides 
monitoring, visualization, and debugging for an OpenWSN-based wireless sensor
network. See the project home page for more information [1].

To install, run the included, standard Python 'setup.py' utility, with the 
command line below. You must have administrator/superuser privileges to 
install to system-level directories.

    > python setup.py install

OpenVisualizer requires several other libraries to run. See the home page for
details.
